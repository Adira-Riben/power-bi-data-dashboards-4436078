Power BI is a powerful data analytics application for modeling data and creating data visualizations. To truly leverage the power of Power BI, you need to use your visuals impactfully to communicate trends and analysis to make decisions. In this course, data analytics and business analysis expert Helen Wall focuses on the Power BI dashboard, where users interact with charts and graphs that communicate trends in their data. Go over building data dashboards, setting up the Power BI model and ecosystem, and choosing colors. Explore various tools to work with and data and visualize it. Learn ways to compare multiple values, and dive into the mapping options available to you. Find out how to customize tooltips, configure chiclet slicers, display Top N rankings, and more, to put it all together in your own dashboard. To wrap up, learn how to share your work with a phone view, publishing to the Power BI service, and sharing Power BI models.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
